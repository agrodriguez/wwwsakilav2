          The Sakila sample database was designed as a replacement to the
          <a class="ulink" href="/doc/world-setup/en/" target="_top"><code class="literal">world</code></a>
          sample database, also provided by Oracle.
        </p>
    <p>
          The <code class="literal">world</code> sample database provides a set of
          tables containing information on the countries and cities of the
          world and is useful for basic queries, but lacks structures for
          testing MySQL-specific functionality and new features found in
          MySQL 5.
        </p>
    <p>
          Development of the Sakila sample database began in early 2005.
          Early designs were based on the database used in the Dell
          whitepaper
          <a class="ulink" href="http://www.dell.com/downloads/global/solutions/mysql_apps.pdf" target="_top">Three
          Approaches to MySQL Applications on Dell PowerEdge
          Servers</a>.
        </p>
    <p>
          Where Dell\'s sample database was designed to represent an online
          DVD store, the Sakila sample database is designed to represent a
          DVD rental store. The Sakila sample database still borrows film
          and actor names from the Dell sample database.
        </p>
    <p>
          Development was accomplished using MySQL Query Browser for schema
          design, with the tables being populated by a combination of MySQL
          Query Browser and custom scripts, in addition to contributor
          efforts (see <a class="xref" href="sakila-acknowledgments.html" title="7&nbsp;Acknowledgments">Section&nbsp;7, “Acknowledgments”</a>).
        </p>
    <p>
          After the basic schema was completed, various views, stored
          routines, and triggers were added to the schema; then the sample
          data was populated. After a series of review versions, the first
          official version of the Sakila sample database was released in
          March 2006.

      The Sakila sample database was initially developed by Mike
      Hillyer, a former member of the MySQL AB documentation team, and
      is intended to provide a standard schema that can be used for
      examples in books, tutorials, articles, samples, and so forth.
      Sakila sample database also serves to highlight the latest
      features of MySQL such as Views, Stored Procedures, and Triggers.
